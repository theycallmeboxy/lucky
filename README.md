A 40-49 key 13 column (mostly) ortho keyboard with fun and easy kitting

DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress and should be considered as a prototype.  I will assume no responsibility for any cost, damage, or sads resulting from trying to make one of my dumb projects.  This project has no implicit support, neither moral nor technical.

Please note there is a defect in prototype 1 resulting is a missing column wire; prototype 2 has not been completed
