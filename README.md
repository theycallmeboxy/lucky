PCB:

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note there is a defect in PCB prototype 1 resulting is a missing
> column wire requiring a bodge; prototype 2 has not been completed.  If you for some silly reason still make this as-is without fixing it.  First, god bless you.  Second, here are the [bodge instructions](https://github.com/theycallmeboxy/lucky/blob/main/img/bodge-instructions.png).


## Build notes:

I have made with FDM and CNC aluminum to good effect.

You will need some hardware for either draft 1 case...
> **For both versions:**
> 
>  - 10 m2x6mm flat screws [such as these     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NHYRAY/)
>    
>   - 16 20mmx3mm gaskets, either 2mm thick foam   [like    these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805527606478.html)  or
>    1.5mm thick silicone   [like these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802713311572.html)
>    
>   - 4 SKUF feet like these  [like    these](https://keeb.io/products/skuf-silicone-rubber-keyboard-feet)
> 
> **For the 3dp version:**
> 
>  - 10 m2x3mmx3.5mm heat set inserts   [such as    these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1ND29M7/)

 1. Install heatset inserts, if applicable.   
 2. Apply feet to the cutouts.
 3. Install stabs if you're into that. 
 4. Install switches into the plate and PCB 
 5. Solder it up Gaskets on both sides of the plate tabs 
 6. Screw it together from the bottom
